<p>Each list entry must have the format: "<code>[target] [search] [search] ..</code>" (for
    example "<code>a ùíú @ √†</code>") whereas
    each "search" (<code>ùíú</code>, <code>@</code> and <code>√†</code>) will be replaced by "target" (<code>a</code>) before Highlight matching takes
    place. This is intended to normalize lookalikes to a single character for
    easier matching. The original "search" characters can not be matched on. In
    other places, for example for display in chat, the original message will be used.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Each "search" is separated by on or several spaces.</li>
    <li>A "search" can be a single Unicode character (char) or several characters
        (word). Replacement takes place in two steps, first chars are replaced,
        then words are replaced.</li>
    <li>Any "search" words that are shorter than the "target" are invalid and
        will be ignored (if the "target" is a single ASCII character that can
        never occur).</li>
    <li>Replacing is case-insensitive, so when <code>√†</code> is specified then
        both <code>√†</code> and <code>√Ä</code> will be replaced.</li>
    <li>Adding a single "<code>#</code>" in place of a "search" will cause all
        following eligible single characters to automatically be added with
        various diacritic marks. Example: "<code>a # a</code>" will search for
        the characters <code>a</code>, <code>√†</code>, <code>√°</code>, <code>√¢</code>, <code>√£</code> (and so on) and replace them with <code>a</code>.
        Adding another "<code>#</code>" will toggle the feature off again for following
        characters.</li>
</ul>
