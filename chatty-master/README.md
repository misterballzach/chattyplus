I learned about most of the Java techniques and APIs used in this during
development, so many things won't be designed ideally. I also never
released such a project as opensource before, so if I missed anything or
didn't adhere to some license correctly, please tell me.

and more information on the features.

Contributions
=============

Contributions to Chatty under the terms of the GPLv3 License (or compatible) are
welcome.

If you're contributing code that you didn't write yourself, make sure to adhere
to whatever license terms it is under (like retaining copyright notices) and to
detail that in the Pull Request.

Obviously, I won't be able to accept all contributions, for example I may
already be working on something similar. If you plan to put more than a little
effort into a Pull Request, consider asking first if what you're doing has a
chance of being added.

Notes on building the program yourself
======================================

The project is compiled using Gradle. Once you've checked it out, you can run
`gradlew build` to compile and run the tests, and `gradlew release` to package
the release artifacts.

If you modified Chatty you should set your own client id in `Chatty.java`. You
may also want to disable the Version Checker.

Main release tasks
------------------

* `release` - Just the regular JAR version Zip
* `releaseWindows` - Regular and Windows Standalone Zip
* `releaseWinSetups` - Everything, including Windows Standalone and Windows setups

Build parameters
----------------

* Windows Standalone (one of these required for the Windows Standalone tasks)
  * `javapackagerPath` - Path to the `javapackager.exe` in the Java 8 JDK
    * `jrePath` - Adds `-Bruntime=` option for javapackager (optional, will use
      default JRE otherwise)
  * `jpackagePath` - Path to the `jpackage.exe` in the Java 14+ JDK (if you
    specify this one, it will use jpackage instead of javapackager)
  * `mtPath` - Path to Microsoft's `mt.exe` (see e.g.
    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54462568/how-to-install-just-mt-exe>),
    used to add `assets-bundle/Chatty.exe.manifest` to the `Chatty.exe`/
    `ChattyPortable.exe` (optional)
* `innosetupPath` - Path to InnoSetup's `iscc.exe` (required for the Windows
  installer tasks)

These build parameters must be specified like this:
`gradlew windowsZip -PjavapackagerPath="<path_to>/javapackager.exe"`

Full example:
`gradlew -Dorg.gradle.java.home="C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.8.0_201" releaseWinSetups --console=verbose -PjavapackagerPath="C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.8.0_201/bin/javapackager.exe" -PjrePath="C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_201" -PinnosetupPath="C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe"`
